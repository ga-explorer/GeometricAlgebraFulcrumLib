\begin_layout Section
Representation of GAPoT Multivectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design of GAPoTNumLib mainly targets the representation and manipulation
 of sparse Euclidean multivectors containing elements of grades 0,1, and
 2.
 Contrast to most general purpose GA libraries, the dimension of vectors
 in GAPoTNumLib is arbitrary, and can be in the range of thouthands.
 Additionally, creation of GAPoTNumLib vectors is formulated to be as close
 as possible to GAPoT symbolic representation of current and voltage vectors.
 Other GAPoT multivectors are constructed using the geometric product of
 GAPoT vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A current or voltage vector in GAPoT is essentially a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 polar phasors of the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
V & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}\mathrm{exp}\left(\theta_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}\sigma_{2i}\right)\sigma_{2i-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are magnitudes and angles of individual phasors.
 We can also re-write this into two equivalent forms.
 The rectangular phasor form is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
V & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}\left(\mathrm{cos}\theta_{i}+\mathrm{sin}\theta_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}\sigma_{2i}\right)\sigma_{2i-1}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}+y_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}\sigma_{2i}\right)\sigma_{2i-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=\alpha_{i}\mathrm{cos}\theta_{i},y_{i}=\alpha_{i}\mathrm{sin}\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are cartesian components of the phasor.
 The third form is the most similar to traditional representation of multivector
s in GA libraries as a sum of scaled basis blades:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
V & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}+y_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}\sigma_{2i}\sigma_{2i-1}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}\sigma_{2i-1}-y_{i}\sigma_{2i}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{2n}v_{i}\sigma_{i}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}=x_{i}=\alpha_{i}\mathrm{cos}\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,3,5,\ldots,2n-1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}=-y_{i}=-\alpha_{i}\mathrm{sin}\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=2,4,6,\ldots,2n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In GAPoTNumLib, a simple textual representation can be used to construct
 GAPoT vectors using either 3 forms: sum of polar phasors, rectangular phasors,
 or terms.
 Internally, however, all GAPoT vectors are stored as a sparse list of terms
 and other forms are composed and displayed to the user on demand.
 The following are examples for the textual representation of vectors in
 GAPoTNumLib:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'-1.3<1>, 1.2<3>, -4.6<6>'
\family default
 represents a GAPoT vector in sum of terms form: 
\begin_inset Formula $-1.3\sigma_{1}+1.2\sigma_{3}-4.6\sigma_{6}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'p(233.92, âˆ’90) <1,2>, p(-120, 30) <3,4>'
\family default
 represents a GAPoT vector in sum of polar phasors form: 
\begin_inset Formula $233.92e^{-90^{\textdegree}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}}\sigma_{1}-120e^{30^{\textdegree}\sigma_{3}\sigma_{4}}\sigma_{3}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'r(10, 20) <1,2>, r(30, 0) <3,4>'
\family default
 represents a GAPoT vector in sum of rectangular phasors form: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(10+20\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)\sigma_{1}+\left(30+0\sigma_{3}\sigma_{4}\right)\sigma_{3}=\left(10\sigma_{1}-20\sigma_{2}\right)+\left(30\sigma_{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 which is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
'10<1>, -20<2>, 30<3>'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'1<1>, r(10, 20) <2,3>, p(-120, 30) <4,5>'
\family default
 represents a GAPoT vector in sum of phasors form: 
\begin_inset Formula $1\sigma_{1}+\left(10+20\sigma_{3}\sigma_{4}\right)\sigma_{3}-120e^{30^{\textdegree}\sigma_{5}\sigma_{6}}\sigma_{5}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geometric product of two GAPoT vectors is a multivector containing only
 grade 0 and 2 elements.
 In GAPoTNumLib such multivectors are called biversors, as they are the
 geometric product of two vectors.
 The user can also create a biversor from a textual representation such
 as 
\family typewriter
'3<>, -2<1,2>, 4<3,4>'
\family default
 which represents the multivector 
\begin_inset Formula $3-2\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}+4\sigma_{3}\sigma_{4}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
GAPoTNumLib Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the .NET solution, the user can find several classes to represent GAPoT
 multivectors under the 
\family typewriter
GAPoTNumLib.GAPoT
\family default
 namespace as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
GaPoTNumVector
\family default
 is the class used to represent GAPoT vectors, typically holding currents
 and voltages.
 The main operations this class provides include setting, getting, and adding
 terms, polar phasors, and rectangular phasors.
 The user can also add and subtract two GAPoT vectors, compute their geometric
 product, find the negative, norm, squared norm, reverse, and inverse of
 a GAPoT vector.
 In addition, several methods for displaying the GAPoT vector in various
 text and LaTeX formats exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
GaPoTNumBiversor
\family default
 is used to represent GAPoT biversors; sparse multivectors which only contains
 elements of grades 0 and 2 typically representing power and impedance.
 The class provides methods for setting, getting, and adding individual
 terms of grade 0 and 2.
 The user can also compute the negative, norm, squared norm, reverse, and
 inverse of biversors.
 There are several methods for extracting power quantities from the biversor
 such as asctive, non-active, reactive, fundamental reactive, and harmful
 power parts.
 In addition, several methods for displaying the GAPoT biversor in various
 text and LaTeX formats exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
GaPoTNumMultivector
\family default
 is capable of representing arbitrary sparse multivectors containing terms
 of grades < 32.
 A vector or biversor can be converted into a multivector using their 
\family typewriter
ToMultivectr()
\family default
 methods.
 The user can extract the vector part (grade 1 terms) of a multivector using
 the 
\family typewriter
GetVectorPart()
\family default
 method, and the same for the 
\family typewriter
GetBiversorPart()
\family default
 method.
 Many computations on multivectors are also implemented like the geometric,
 outer, left-contraction, and scalar products using the methods 
\family typewriter
Gp()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Op()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Lcp()
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
Sp()
\family default
 in addition to the reverse, inverse, negative, squared norm, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the elements of a GAPoT vector, there are three classes that can be
 used to hold information on terms and phasors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
GaPoTNumVectorTerm
\family default
 holds a single term vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
GaPoTNumPolarPhasor
